Specifically:
No user accounts are required
No personal information is requested
No analytics or tracking frameworks are used
No data is sent to external servers
All bookmarks and folders created in PocketLinks are stored locally on your device.

Bookmark Data

Any links, titles, folders, or browser preferences you save in PocketLinks remain on your device unless you choose to back them up using iOS system features such as iCloud.
